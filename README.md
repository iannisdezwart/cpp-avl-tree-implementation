# AVL Tree Implementation in C++

This is a simple implementation of an AVL Tree in C++ for research purposes.
Consists of a header file `avl_tree.hpp` that holds the implementation
of the AVL Tree class, a header file `test.hpp` that holds code for unit tests,
and a source file `main.cpp` that can be compiled into a program that
has an interactive demo and a randomised testing tool.
